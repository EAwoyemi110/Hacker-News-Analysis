# Hacker-News-Analysis
Analyzing Hacker News data with Python to see what actually drives post engagement. By processing 20,000+ posts using csv and datetime modules, I compared "Ask HN" vs. "Show HN" performance and tracked how submission timing affects comments. It’s a practical look at using data to find the "sweet spot" for reaching the tech community.

Project Title: Hacker News Engagement Analysis
Key Questions:
Do "Ask HN" or "Show HN" posts receive more comments on average?
Does the time of day affect the number of comments a post receives?
Dataset:
Briefly mention the source (Y Combinator's Hacker News) and that it contains ~20,000 rows.


Technologies Used:
Language: Python 3.x
Modules: csv (data parsing), datetime (time-series manipulation), matplotlib (visualize data).


Key Findings:
Example: "Ask HN" posts created at 15:00 (3 PM EST) receive the highest average number of comments.
How to Run:
Include a short instruction like: python hacker_news.py.
